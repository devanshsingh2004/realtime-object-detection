# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8

This project is a real-time object detection system using a webcam and the YOLOv8s model from Ultralytics.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Detects 10+ common objects in real-time
- Uses pre-trained YOLOv8s model
- GPU acceleration for high FPS
- Live bounding boxes and confidence scores
